Eye  gaze is defined as the direction the eyes are pointing in space ("Proceedings of Fifth IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face Gesture Recognition," Proceedings of Fifth IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face Gesture Recognition, 2002, pp. , doi: 10.1109/AFGR.2002.1004121).

Track : b. a path made by or as if by repeated footfalls : trail. ( Meriam-Webster dictionary).

Eye gaze is defined as the line of sight of a person (Z. Zhu and Q. Ji, "Novel Eye Gaze Tracking Techniques Under Natural Head Movement," in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, vol. 54, no. 12, pp. 2246-2260, Dec. 2007, doi: 10.1109/TBME.2007.895750).
